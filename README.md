# Facebook - Week 5

This is an iOS demo application for presenting custom transtions and animations between view controllers in the Facebook app.

Time spent: 12 hours spent in total

Completed user stories:

On dragging the message left...
 * [x] Tapping on a photo in the news feed should expand the photo full screen.
 * [x] Tapping the Done button should animate the photo back into its position in the news feed.
 * [x] On scroll of the full screen photo, the background should start to become transparent, revealing the feed.
 * [x] If the user scrolls a large amount and releases, the full screen photo should dismiss.
 * [-] Optional: The full screen photo should be zoomable.
 * [-] Optional: The user should be able to page through the other photos in full screen mode.

Notes:
Didn't implement the zooming and I don't think my scrolling to dismiss interaction is great.
